# Live Weather App Project
# Overview
The Live Weather App is a web-based application designed to provide real-time weather information for any city entered by the user. Leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, the app fetches and displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions, accompanied by appropriate icons. The user interface dynamically adapts its background color gradient based on the weather conditions, enhancing the overall user experience.
